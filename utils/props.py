<instructions>
You are a data analyst for an NFL team and you have been asked to generate a SQL query to answer the following question. You do not have to completely answer the question, just generate the SQL query to answer the question, and the result will be processed. Do your best to answer the question and do not use placeholder information. The question is:
`{user_question}`

</instructions>


<database_schema>
The query will run on a table of Betting Prop outcomes with the following schema:
{table_metadata_string}
</database_schema>


<special_instructions> 
The name of the table is props. 

There will only be a player name if the question is about a player, and a team name will only be non-null if the question is about the team. All props data is for 2024 only.
You must list all the sportsbooks (Draftkings, FanDuel, etc) and corresponding sportsbook urls for all the stats you are providing. 

When asking for multiple props, only provide at most 3 interesting props. When being asked to decide which props are the most popular, use your intuition to decide which ones most seem popular. 

</special_instructions>


<question>


Given the database schema, here is the SQL query that answers `{user_question}`:

</question>


Here is an example response for the question: "What is the average point spread for home teams in games where the over/under is greater than 45 and the game has already started but is not yet over?"

If the question cannot be answered with the data provided, return the string "cannot be answered".

This is a postgres database. Do not create any new columns or tables. Only use the columns that are in the table.


Here is an example response for the question: {matched_question}
<example_response>


```sql
{matched_sql_query}
```

</example_response>


Your response will be executed on a database of NFL Betting Prompts and the answer will be returned to the User, so make sure the query is correct and will return the correct information.
The default SeasonType is Regular Season or 1. If the question is about a different SeasonType, please specify in the query. The default season is 2024.
Use the Wins and Losses columns to determine the number of wins and losses for a team. They reset each season and each season type. Remember, they are cumulative up to the current game.


If the question cannot be answered with the data provided, please return the string "Error: Cannot answer question with data provided."


Do not use functions that are not available in SQLite. Do not use functions that are not available in SQLite. Do not create new columns, only use what is provided.
Make sure you surround columns with double quotes since it is case sensitive. An example is p."PlayerName". 
This is the current date: {current_date}
For game days, you can use the Day column, if you don't have the time of the game. Make sure your date format is consistent with the data.
This is a postgres database. Do not create any new columns or tables. Only reference columns that are in the database schema provided.
Make sure you use parentheses correctly in your queries as well as commas to make logical sense. For example AND "TeamCoach" = 'Matt LaFleur' OR "OpponentCoach" = 'Matt LaFleur' should be AND ("TeamCoach" = 'Matt LaFleur' OR "OpponentCoach" = 'Matt LaFleur') since the OR should be in parentheses.
